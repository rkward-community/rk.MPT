# rk.MPT

This R package provides a GUI for multinomial processing tree (MPT) models.

**This package is currently broken/outdated and not recommended for practical use!**

It is a plugin package for [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org), a powerful GUI and IDE for [R](https://r-project.org),
and will **only work in conjunction with RKWard**. However, RKWard is free software, please
[check it out](https://rkward.kde.org).

## Installation

### Installation via RKWard

After you installed RKWard, simply install this package like any other R package. The easiest way to get the most
recent stable release is to use RKWard's package management:

- Go to `Settings` -> `Manage R packages and plugins...` -> `Install/Update/Remove R packages`
- Check `Show only packages providing RKWard dialogs` and look at `New Packages`
- Check the desired package(s) and hit `Apply`

After you installed the package, RKWard should immediately have additional menu entries -- there's
usually no need to restart the application.

### Installation via GitHub

To install it directly from GitHub, you can use `install_github()` from the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("rkward-community/rk.MPT")
```

You can safely ignore warnings about the (unavailable) package "rkward", it was installed together with RKWard.

This plugin is built using the [rkwarddev](https://files.kde.org/rkward/R/pckg/rkwarddev/index.html) package. This means that its development is mainly focussed on one
script file, located at `rk.MPT/inst/rkward/rkwarddev_MPT_plugin_script.R`. This script is written in `R` code and *generates*
all of the other plugin files when run. Therefore, in case you'd like to add to this plugin, please add to this script file.

### Branches

Please note that all development happens in the `develop` branch. Pull requests against the `master` branch will be rejected, as it is reserved for the current stable release.
